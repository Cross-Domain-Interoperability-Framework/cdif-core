# cdif-core
A repository to host the core interoperability specifications for CDIF

There are two top level subdirectories:

**in_review**: hosts proposed templates and guidance documents for different resource types or metadata components.

**adopted**: host templates that have been reviewed and tested by the CDIF working group and are recommended for use.

Subdirectories in these top level directories host templates and guidance documents for particular resource types or metadata components. The templates are example instance documents serialised in [JSON-LD](https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11/) using the [schema.org](https://schema.org/) vocabulary. [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/specification) or [SHACL](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/)/[SHEX](https://github.com/shexSpec/shex/wiki/ShEx) rule sets might also be provided for validation.
